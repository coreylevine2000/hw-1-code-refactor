# hw-1-code-refactor

Appropriate titles have been given to the websites elements and classes to replace the abundent "div" with Header, Section, Aside, and Footer.

Removed repetative code on the site's stylesheet which was classed individually for all images, sections, and/or aside elements. By renaming one parent element with its children, I was able to apply all similar code for respective areas. 

Provided atl= tags with appropriate naming to assist those who are visually impared or for site image issues loading
